I am to be a well-rounded developer by studying software engineering principles and technologies alongside Salesforce material and best practices.
I'm studying for Salesforce certs right now. 
I'm following this study guide: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/users/strailhead/trailmixes/prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-developer-i-credential

When I first learned about Salesforce, I remember it was very unfamiliar to me, and I had no idea what it did. 

A summary of what Salesforce is: at its core, it's a cloud-based SAAS and a standardized PAAS.
As a developer, I mostly utilize the PAAS aspect, involving development of new features based on existing code or existing SAAS features rolled out by Salesforce. 
Development is full-stack with OOP programming in Apex, javascript, and simplified SQL.

This is an example article of what the back-end coding is like in Salesforce:

A lot of Salesforce's articles are pretty self-promotional, but they have separate documentation for developers that generally provides readable details.
